// No worries on being light on JS for now, the main 2 things I think you can start with will be:
// 1. Handling the change between form tabs using JS (click event triggers CSS changes to switch displayed content)
// 2. Adding a button to 'save form' which will pull the data into LocalStorage for persistence

// Both of these rely heavily on HTML infrastructure being built so that is still your first priority!

// Break things into small pieces as much as possible and test often (console.log() and error messages)
// small changes are easier to debug than building half your app and finding out you went astray somewhere
